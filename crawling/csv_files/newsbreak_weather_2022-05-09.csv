Gustnadoes typically produce winds near 50 mph but occasionally become a bit stronger and may be capable of causing minor damage to structures, but injuries are very rare. Strong thunderstorms contain powerful downdrafts that, when striking the ground, spread outward and cause a rush of wind at the surface. If there is sufficient instability, a gustnado might form."
