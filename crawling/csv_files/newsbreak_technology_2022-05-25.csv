Robot mowers are perfect for smaller suburban lawns because they have very small cutting decks, often just 8 or 9 inches wide. The included reels of guidewire also are often just big enough to mark off the edge of a quarter acre to half acre lot or the same size area of much larger lawns. The appeal of a robot lawn mower is that they are fully autonomous. Once you set up a schedule, you don't have to worry about being home to mow your lawn; the unit will leave the base station and start cutting the grass all on its own once it is time to start."
