42,science,A 'beyond-quantum' equivalence principle for superposition and entanglement,"The physics of the microrealm involves two famous and bizarre concepts: The first is that prior to observation, it is impossible to know with certainty the outcome of a measurement on a particle; rather the particle exists in a ""superposition"" encompassing multiple mutually exclusive states. So a particle can be in two or more places at the same time, and you can only calculate the probability of finding it in a certain location when you look. The second involves ""entanglement,"" the spooky link that can unite two objects, no matter how far they are separated. Both superposition and entanglement are described mathematically by quantum theory. But many physicists believe that the ultimate theory of reality may lie beyond quantum theory. Now, a team of physicists and mathematicians has discovered a new connection between these two weird properties that does not assume that quantum theory is correct. Their study appears in Physical Review Letters."

Scientists have detected the brightest pulsar ever observed outside the Milky Way, revealing the true identity of a far-off luminous object previously mistaken for a distant galaxy.
Pulsars are incredibly dense neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their poles.
Due to the way these objects rapidly rotate, their high-energy emissions appear as short, periodic pulses when observed from elsewhere in space, kind of like a cosmic lighthouse glimpsed intermittently from afar.
Since their discovery in the 1960s by Irish astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell, over 2,000 pulsars have been detected, but the vast majority of these shiny, whirling objects are located inside..."

59,science,The development of FriedlÃ¤nder heteroannulation through a single electron transfer and energy transfer pathway using methylene blue (MB),"The radical FriedlÃ¤nder hetero-annulation of 2-aminoaryl ketone and -methylene carbonyl compound was used to develop a green tandem approach for the metal-free synthesis of polysubstitutedquinolines. At room temperature in an ethanol solvent, photo-excited state functions generated from MB+ were used as single-electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (EnT) catalysts, utilizing visible light as a renewable energy source in the air atmosphere. The purpose of this research is to increase the use of a nonmetal cationic dye that is both inexpensive and widely available. High yields, energy-effectiveness, high atom economy, time-saving features of the reaction, and operational simplicity, and the least amount of a catalyst are the benefits of this study. As a result, a wide range of ecological and long-term chemical properties are obtained. Polysubstitutedquinolines' turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) have been calculated. Surprisingly, such cyclization can be accomplished on a gram scale, indicating that the process has industrial potential."

71,science,Genomes from Verteba cave suggest diversity within the Trypillians in Ukraine,"The transition to agriculture occurred relatively late in Eastern Europe, leading researchers to debate whether it was a gradual, interactive process or a colonisation event. In the forest and forest-steppe regions of Ukraine, farming appeared during the fifth millennium BCE, associated with the Cucuteni-Trypillia cultural complex (CTCC,""‰~""‰5000""“3000 BCE). Across Europe, the Neolithisation process was highly variable across space and over time. Here, we investigate the population dynamics of early agriculturalists from the eastern forest-steppe region based on the analyses of 20 ancient genomes from the site of Verteba Cave (3935""“825Â cal BCE). Results reveal that the CTCC individuals' ancestry is related to both western hunter-gatherers and Near Eastern farmers, has no local ancestry associated with Ukrainian Neolithic hunter-gatherers and has steppe ancestry. An Early Bronze Age individual has an ancestry profile related to the Yamnaya expansions but with 20% of ancestry related to the other Trypillian individuals, which suggests admixture between the Trypillians and the incoming populations carrying steppe-related ancestry. A Late Bronze Age individual dated to 980""“825Â cal BCE has a genetic profile indicating affinity to Beaker-related populations, detected close to 1000Â years after the end of the Bell Beaker phenomenon during the third millennium BCE."
72,science,Bilayer-folded lamellar mesophase induced by random polymer sequence,"Randomness is perceived in two different extremes, in macroscopic homogeneity and local heterogeneity, but apparently far away from order. Here we show that a periodic order spontaneously arises from a binary random copolymer when self-assembly occurs in an ensemble containing > 1015 possible chain sequences. A Bernoullian distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains grafted onto a linear backbone was constructed by random copolymerization. When the polymer chains associate in water, a sequence matching problem occurs because of the drastic heterogeneity in sequence: this is believed to generate local curvature mismatches which deviate from the ensemble-averaged interfacial curvature. Periodic folding of the self-assembled bilayer stabilizes the curvature instability as recurring hinges. Reminiscent of chain-folded lamellae found in polymer crystallization, this new liquid crystalline mesophase, characterized as bilayer-folded lamellae, manifests itself as an anisotropically alignable birefringent hydrogel with structural hierarchy across multiple length scales."

74,science,Influence of nutrient supply on plankton microbiome biodiversity and distribution in a coastal upwelling region,"The ecological and oceanographic processes that drive the response of pelagic ocean microbiomes to environmental changes remain poorly understood, particularly in coastal upwelling ecosystems. Here we show that seasonal and interannual variability in coastal upwelling predicts pelagic ocean microbiome diversity and community structure in the Southern California Current region. Ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, targeting prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, from samples collected seasonally during 2014-2020 indicate that nitracline depth is the most robust predictor of spatial microbial community structure and biodiversity in this region. Striking ecological changes occurred due to the transition from a warm anomaly during 2014-2016, characterized by intense stratification, to cooler conditions in 2017-2018, representative of more typical upwelling conditions, with photosynthetic eukaryotes, especially diatoms, changing most strongly. The regional slope of nitracline depth exerts strong control on the relative proportion of highly diverse offshore communities and low biodiversity, but highly productive nearshore communities."
75,science,"Cheaper, Faster New Way To Continuously Produce Amines – Chemical Building Blocks Used in Many Products","Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a faster, less expensive technique for producing hindered amines – a class of chemicals used as building blocks in products ranging from pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals to detergents and organic light-emitting diodes. The success of the new technique is made possible by two things. First, by using a continuous flow reactor that allows for continuous flow of both gases and liquids in a segmented flow format, the researchers were able to make the kinetics of the reaction far more efficient. Second, the new technique makes use of a co-catalyst – fluorinated benzoic acid – which reduces the amount of energy needed to perform some of the necessary reactions in the process.

76,science,In-vitro NET-osis induced by COVID-19 sera is associated to severe clinical course in not vaccinated patients and immune-dysregulation in breakthrough infection,"Since neutrophil extracellular traps formation (NET-osis) can be assessed indirectly by treating healthy neutrophils with blood-derived fluids from patients and then measuring the NETs response, we designed a pilot study to convey high-dimensional cytometry of peripheral blood immune cells and cytokines, combined with clinical features, to understand if NET-osis assessment could be included in the immune risk profiling to early prediction of clinical patterns, disease severity, and viral clearance at 28Â days in COVID-19 patients. Immune cells composition of peripheral blood, cytokines concentration and in-vitro NETosis were detected in peripheral blood of 41 consecutive COVID-19 inpatients, including 21 mild breakthrough infections compared to 20 healthy donors, matched for sex and age. Major immune dysregulation in peripheral blood in not-vaccinated COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects included: a significant reduction of percentage of unswitched memory B-cells and transitional B-cells; loss of naÃ¯ve CD3+CD4+CD45RA+ and CD3+CD8+CD45RA+ cells, increase of IL-1Î², IL-17A and IFN-Î³. Myeloid compartment was affected as well, due to the increase of classical (CD14++CD16âˆ’) and intermediate (CD14++CD16+) monocytes, overexpressing the activation marker CD64, negatively associated to the absolute counts of CD8+""‰CD45R0+""‰cells, IFN-Î³ and IL-6, and expansion of monocytic-like myeloid derived suppressor cells. In not-vaccinated patients who achieved viral clearance by 28Â days we found at hospital admission lower absolute counts of effector cells, namely CD8+T cells, CD4+ T-cells and CD4+CD45RO+ T cells. Percentage of in-vitro NET-osis induced by patients' sera and NET-osis density were progressively higher in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients than in mild disease and controls. The percentage of in-vitro induced NET-osis was positively associated to circulating cytokines IL-1Î², IFN-Î³ and IL-6. In breakthrough COVID-19 infections, characterized by mild clinical course, we observed increased percentage of in-vitro NET-osis, higher CD4+""‰CD45RO+""‰and CD8+""‰CD45RO+""‰T cells healthy or mild-COVID-19 not-vaccinated patients, reduced by 24Â h of treatment with ACE inhibitor ramipril. Taken together our data highlight the role of NETs in orchestrating the complex immune response to SARS-COV-2, that should be considered in a multi-target approach for COVID-19 treatment."

78,science,Using sero-epidemiology to monitor disparities in vaccination and infection with SARS-CoV-2,"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and vaccines are rolled-out, the ""double burden"" of disparities in exposure and vaccination intersect to determine patterns of infection, immunity, and mortality. Serology provides a unique opportunity to measure prior infection and vaccination simultaneously. Leveraging algorithmically-selected residual sera from two hospital networks in the city of San Francisco, cross-sectional samples from 1,014 individuals from February 4""“17, 2021 were each tested on two assays (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2), capturing the first year of the epidemic and early roll-out of vaccination. We estimated, using Bayesian estimation of infection and vaccination, that infection risk of Hispanic/Latinx residents was five times greater than of White residents aged 18""“64 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 3.2""“10.3), and that White residents over 65 were twice as likely to be vaccinated as Black/African American residents (95% CrI: 1.1""“4.6). We found that socioeconomically-deprived zipcodes had higher infection probabilities and lower vaccination coverage than wealthier zipcodes. While vaccination has created a 'light at the end of the tunnel' for this pandemic, ongoing challenges in achieving and maintaining equity must also be considered."
79,science,Dynamic observation of dendrite growth on lithium metal anode during battery charging/discharging cycles,"Lithium metal is considered one of the most promising anode materials for application in next-generation batteries. However, despite decades of research, practical application of lithium metal batteries has not yet been achieved because the fundamental interfacial mechanism of lithium dendrite growth is not yet fully understood. In this study, a series of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was performed to investigate the electrochemical dynamic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It allows quantitative characterization of morphological phenomena and real-time interfacial visualization of the dynamic growth of dead lithium and dendrites during repeated charging. This computational protocol was utilized to investigate the dendrite mitigation mechanism when an electrolyte additive (hydrogen fluoride) is dissolved in an organic ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolyte solvent. It was confirmed that beneficial decomposition reactions between electrolyte components form a protective film on the anode surface, suppressing large interphase volume changes and unnecessary degradation reactions."

81,science,Modulating Pt-O-Pt atomic clusters with isolated cobalt atoms for enhanced hydrogen evolution catalysis,"Platinum is the most efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic conditions, but its widespread use has been impeded by scarcity and high cost. Herein, Pt atomic clusters (Pt ACs) containing Pt-O-Pt units were prepared using Co/N co-doped carbon (CoNC) as support. Pt ACs are anchored to single Co atoms on CoNC by forming strong interactions. Pt-ACs/CoNC exhibits only 24""‰mV overpotential at 10""‰mA""‰cmâˆ’2 and a high mass activity of 28.6""‰A""‰mgâˆ’1 at 50""‰mV, which is more than 6 times higher than commercial Pt/C with any Pt loadings. Spectroscopic measurements and computational modeling reveal the enhanced hydrogen generation activity attributes to the charge redistribution between Pt and O atoms in Pt-O-Pt units, making Pt atoms the main active sites and O linkers the assistants, thus optimizing the proton adsorption and hydrogen desorption. This work opens an avenue to fabricate noble-metal-based ACs stabilized by single-atom catalysts with desired properties for electrocatalysis."
82,science,Understanding the rheology of nanocontacts,"Mechanical stiffness, as opposed to softness, is a fundamental property of solids. Its persistence or rheological evolution in vibrating solid-solid nanocontacts is important in physics, materials science and technology. A puzzling apparent liquefaction under oscillatory strain, totally unexpected at room temperature, was suggested by recent experiments on solid gold nano-junctions. Here we show theoretically that realistically simulated nanocontacts actually remain crystalline even under large oscillatory strains. Tensile and compressive slips, respectively of ""necking"" and ""bellying"" types, do take place, but recover reversibly even during fast oscillatory cycles. We also show that, counterintuitively, the residual stress remains tensile after both slips, driving the averaged stiffness from positive to negative, thus superficially mimicking a liquid's. Unlike a liquid, however, rheological softening occurs by stick-slip, predicting largely frequency independent stiffness with violent noise in stress and conductance, properties compatible with experiments. The baffling large amplitude rheology of gold nanocontacts and its consequences should apply, with different parameters, to many other metals."

To manage and protect water resources, it is necessary to understand the water cycle. Passive microwave radiometers onboard satellites are used to monitor water resources, like soil moisture. However, microwave sensors, such as radiometers, are too coarse to see small-scale meteorological features, which can affect large-scale phenomena occurring within the water cycle. Other spaceborne instruments produce finer-resolution images, but these instruments are much more sensitive to cloud contamination, limiting their useful coverage."
84,science,Drivers of ecological assembly in the hindgut of Atlantic Cod fed a macroalgal supplemented diet,"It is difficult to disentangle the many variables (e.g. internal or external cues and random events) that shape the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract of any living species. Ecological assembly processes applied to microbial communities can elucidate these drivers. In our study, farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were fed a diet of 10% macroalgae supplement (Ulva rigida [ULVA] or Ascophyllum nodosum [ASCO] or a non-supplemented control diet [CTRL]) over 12 weeks. We determined the influence of ecological assembly processes using a suite of null-modelling tools. We observed dissimilarity in the abundance of common OTUs over time, which was driven by deterministic assembly. The CTRL samples showed selection as a critical assembly process. While dispersal limitation was a driver of the gut microbiome for fish fed the macroalgae supplemented diet at Week 12 (i.e., ASCO and ULVA). Fish from the ASCO grouping diverged into ASCO_N (normal) and ASCO_LG (lower growth), where ASCO_LG individuals found the diet unpalatable. The recruitment of new taxa overtime was altered in the ASCO_LG fish, with the gut microbiome showing phylogenetic underdispersion (nepotistic species recruitment). Finally, the gut microbiome (CTRL and ULVA) showed increasing robustness to taxonomic disturbance over time and lower functional redundancy. This study advances our understanding of the ecological assembly and succession in the hindgut of juvenile Atlantic cod across dietary treatments. Understanding the processes driving ecological assembly in the gut microbiome, in fish research specifically, could allow us to manipulate the microbiome for improved health or resilience to disease for improved aquaculture welfare and production."

86,science,Experimentally measuring weak fracture toughness anisotropy in graphene,"The two-dimensional nature of graphene offers a number of interesting mechanical properties. Amongst these, fracture toughness has received substantial interest, yet computational works have not reached a consensus regarding anisotropy in its fracture energy when graphene is loaded in armchair or zigzag directions. Here, we resolve the steps involved during fracture of graphene by carrying out in situ tensile tests. Embryo cracks nucleated from the graphene edges are observed to deflect into major cracks with local kinking features, as explained by an evolving stress intensity factor during crack advance. Extended finite element analysis with the maximum energy release rate criterion is used to model the fracture process. We determine a weak degree of anisotropy in the fracture toughness, Gc(armchair)/Gc(zigzag), of 0.94, which aligns with previous predictions from first-principles calculations and observed growth kinetics of graphene crystals in experiments."
87,science,The transcription factor complex LMO2/TAL1 regulates branching and endothelial cell migration in sprouting angiogenesis,"The transcription factor complex, consisting of LMO2, TAL1 or LYL1, and GATA2, plays an important role in capillary sprouting by regulating VEGFR2, DLL4, and angiopoietin 2 in tip cells. Overexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor LYL1 in transgenic mice results in shortened tails. This phenotype is associated with vessel hyperbranching and a relative paucity of straight vessels due to DLL4 downregulation in tip cells by forming aberrant complex consisting of LMO2 and LYL1. Knockdown of LMO2 or TAL1 inhibits capillary sprouting in spheroid-based angiogenesis assays, which is associated with decreased angiopoietin 2 secretion. In the same assay using mixed TAL1- and LYL1-expressing endothelial cells, TAL1 was found to be primarily located in tip cells, while LYL1-expressing cells tended to occupy the stalk position in sprouts by upregulating VEGFR1 than TAL1. Thus, the interaction between LMO2 and TAL1 in tip cells plays a key role in angiogenic switch of sprouting angiogenesis."
88,science,Dichotomy of the BSL phosphatase signaling spatially regulates MAPK components in stomatal fate determination,"MAPK signaling modules play crucial roles in regulating numerous biological processes in all eukaryotic cells. How MAPK signaling specificity and strength are tightly controlled remains a major challenging question. In Arabidopsis stomatal development, the MAPKK Kinase YODA (YDA) functions at the cell periphery to inhibit stomatal production by activating MAPK 3 and 6 (MPK3/6) that directly phosphorylate stomatal fate-determining transcription factors for degradation in the nucleus. Recently, we demonstrated that BSL1, one of the four BSL protein phosphatases, localizes to the cell cortex to activate YDA, elevating MPK3/6 activity to suppress stomatal formation. Here, we showed that at the plasma membrane, all four members of BSL proteins contribute to the YDA activation. However, in the nucleus, specific BSL members (BSL2, BSL3, and BSU1) directly deactivate MPK6 to counteract the linear MAPK pathway, thereby promoting stomatal formation. Thus, the pivotal MAPK signaling in stomatal fate determination is spatially modulated by a signaling dichotomy of the BSL protein phosphatases in Arabidopsis, providing a prominent example of how MAPK activities are integrated and specified by signaling compartmentalization at the subcellular level."

90,science,Intimate relationships among actinomycetes and mycolic acid-containing bacteria,"Co-culture is an efficient strategy for natural product discovery. We have used mycolic acid-containing bacteria (MACB) Tsukamurella pumonis TP-B0596 to induce secondary metabolism by actinomycetes and have found several natural products. We also observed that MACB attached to the mycelium of Streptomyces lividans forming coaggregates during combined-culture. This stimulated interest in the interactions among actinomycetes and MACB, and we found that soil isolated cultures contained a mixture of actinomycetes and MACB. Our previously observed interactions were the result of selective screening and combination of bacteria in the lab, which warranted investigation of the existence of these interactions in the natural soil environment. Therefore, in this paper, we report the interaction between a co-isolated natural pair of actinomycetes and MACB in terms of morphology and metabolic changes. A natural pair of actinomycetes and MACB co-aggregated in liquid culture and showed metabolic changes. Interestingly, co-aggregated actinomycetes and MACB were re-isolated from soil with no obvious morphological colony differences from the colony of a single strain. The results demonstrate that there is a stochastic chance of picking colonies containing co-aggregated actinomycetes and MACB, which suggests that the pair can exist in co-aggregate form in the soil environment and interact with each other."
91,science,Progressive compressive sensing of large images with multiscale deep learning reconstruction,"Compressive sensing (CS) is a sub-Nyquist sampling framework that has been employed to improve the performance of numerous imaging applications during the last 15Â years. Yet, its application for large and high-resolution imaging remains challenging in terms of the computation and acquisition effort involved. Often, low-resolution imaging is sufficient for most of the considered tasks and only a fraction of cases demand high resolution, but the problem is that the user does not know in advance when high-resolution acquisition is required. To address this, we propose a multiscale progressive CS method for the high-resolution imaging. The progressive sampling refines the resolution of the image, while incorporating the already sampled low-resolution information, making the process highly efficient. Moreover, the multiscale property of the progressively sensed samples is capitalized for a fast, deep learning (DL) reconstruction, otherwise infeasible due to practical limitations of training on high-resolution images. The progressive CS and the multiscale reconstruction method are analyzed numerically and demonstrated experimentally with a single pixel camera imaging system. We demonstrate 4-megapixel size progressive compressive imaging with about half the overall number of samples, more than an order of magnitude faster reconstruction, and improved reconstruction quality compared to alternative conventional CS approaches."
92,science,North Asian population relationships in a global context,"Population genetic studies of North Asian ethnic groups have focused on genetic variation of sex chromosomes and mitochondria. Studies of the extensive variation available from autosomal variation have appeared infrequently. We focus on relationships among population samples using new North Asia microhaplotype data. We combined genotypes from our laboratory on 58 microhaplotypes, distributed across 18 autosomes, on 3945 individuals from 75 populations with corresponding data extracted for 26 populations from the Thousand Genomes consortium and for 22 populations from the GenomeAsia 100Â K project. A total of 7107 individuals in 122 total populations are analyzed using STRUCTURE, Principal Component Analysis, and phylogenetic tree analyses. North Asia populations sampled in Mongolia include: Buryats, Mongolians, Altai Kazakhs, and Tsaatans. Available Siberians include samples of Yakut, Khanty, and Komi Zyriane. Analyses of all 122 populations confirm many known relationships and show that most populations from North Asia form a cluster distinct from all other groups. Refinement of analyses on smaller subsets of populations reinforces the distinctiveness of North Asia and shows that the North Asia cluster identifies a region that is ancestral to Native Americans."

94,science,Taxonomic and functional trait-based approaches suggest that aerobic and anaerobic soil microorganisms allow the natural attenuation of oil from natural seeps,"Natural attenuation, involving microbial adaptation, helps mitigating the effect of oil contamination of surface soils. We hypothesized that in soils under fluctuating conditions and receiving oil from seeps, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as fungi could coexist to efficiently degrade hydrocarbons and prevent the spread of pollution. Microbial community diversity was studied in soil longitudinal and depth gradients contaminated with petroleum seeps for at least a century. Hydrocarbon contamination was high just next to the petroleum seeps but this level drastically lowered from 2Â m distance and beyond. Fungal abundance and alpha-diversity indices were constant along the gradients. Bacterial abundance was constant but alpha-diversity indices were lower next to the oil seeps. Hydrocarbon contamination was the main driver of microbial community assemblage. 281 bacterial OTUs were identified as indicator taxa, tolerant to hydrocarbon, potentially involved in hydrocarbon-degradation or benefiting from the degradation by-products. These taxa belonging to lineages of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, have specific functional traits indicating the development of a complex community adapted to the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and to fluctuating conditions. Fungi are less impacted by oil contamination but few taxa should contribute to the metabolic complementary within the microbial consortia forming an efficient barrier against petroleum dissemination."

96,science,Role of the M point phonons for the dynamical stability of B2 compounds,"Although many binary compounds have the B2 (CsCl-type) structure in the thermodynamic phase diagram, an origin of the dynamical stability is not understood well. Here, we focus on 416 compounds in the B2 structure extracted from the Materials Project, and study the dynamical stability of those compounds from first principles. We demonstrate that the dynamical stability of the B2 compounds lies in whether the lowest frequency phonons around the M point in the Brillouin zone are endowed with a positive frequency, except for VRu. We show that the interatomic interactions up to the fourth nearest neighbor atoms are necessary for stabilizing such phonon modes, which should determine the minimum cutoff radius for constructing the interatomic potentials of binary compounds with guaranteed accuracy."
97,science,Novel preparation of functional Î²-SiC fiber based InO nanocomposite and controlling of influence factors for the chemical gas sensing,"The gas sensing ability of a pure Î²-SiC fiber is limited due to its low-sensitivity and selectivity with poor recovery time during a gas sensing test. The combination of functional Î²-SiC fibers with metal-oxide (MO) can lead to excellent electronic conductivity, boosted chemical activity, and high reaction activity with the target gas and Î²-SiC""“In2O3 sensor material. Influence factors such as amounts of MO, current collectors, and gas species (CO2, O2 and without gas) for the gas sensing ability of Î²-SiC""“In2O3 nanocomposite were determined at standard room temperature (25Â Â°C) and high temperature (350Â Â°C) conditions. The gas sensing ability of the functional Î²-SiC fiber was significantly enhanced by the loading of In2O3 metal-oxide. In addition, the MO junction on the Î²-SiC fiber was mainly subjected to the Si""“C""“O""“In bond sensor layer with an effective electron-transfer ability. The gas sensing mechanism was based on the transfer of charges, in which the sensing material acted as an absorber or a donor of charges. The sensor material could use different current- collectors to support the electron transfer and gas sensing ability of the material. A 1:0.5M SiC""“In2O3 coated Ni-foil current collector sensor showed better sensing ability for CO2 and O2 gases than other gas sensors at room temperature and high temperature conditions. The sensing result of the electrode was obtained with different current density values without or with gas purging conditions because CO2 and O2 gases had electron acceptor properties. During the gas sensing test, the sensor material donated electrons to target gases. The current value on the CV graph then significantly changed. Our obtained sample analysis data and the gas sensing test adequately demonstrated that MO junctions on functional Î²-SiC fibers could improve the sensitivity of a sensor material and particularly upgrade the sensor material for gas sensing."
98,science,Identification of DAXX as a restriction factor of SARS-CoV-2 through a CRISPR/Cas9 screen,"Interferon restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture, but only a handful of Interferon Stimulated Genes with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identify DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX is sufficient to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and DAXX over-expression further restricts infection. DAXX restricts an early, post-entry step of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 is independent of the SUMOylation pathway but dependent on its D/E domain, also necessary for its protein-folding activity. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites and promotes its degradation. Mechanistically, this process is mediated by the viral papain-like protease (PLpro) and the proteasome. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX restricts SARS-CoV-2, which in turn has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action."
99,science,First crystal structures of 1-deoxy--xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis indicate a distinct mechanism of intermediate stabilization,"The development of drug resistance by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogenic bacteria emphasizes the need for new antibiotics. Unlike animals, most bacteria synthesize isoprenoid precursors through the MEP pathway. 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the first reaction of the MEP pathway and is an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics. We report here the successful use of a loop truncation to crystallize and solve the first DXPS structures of a pathogen, namely M. tuberculosis (MtDXPS). The main difference found to other DXPS structures is in the active site where a highly coordinated water was found, showing a new mechanism for the enamine-intermediate stabilization. Unlike other DXPS structures, a ""fork-like"" motif could be identified in the enamine structure, using a different residue for the interaction with the cofactor, potentially leading to a decrease in the stability of the intermediate. In addition, electron density suggesting a phosphate group could be found close to the active site, provides new evidence for the D-GAP binding site. These results provide the opportunity to improve or develop new inhibitors specific for MtDXPS through structure-based drug design."
100,science,Cofilactin filaments regulate filopodial structure and dynamics in neuronal growth cones,"Cofilin is best known for its ability to sever actin filaments and facilitate cytoskeletal recycling inside of cells, but at higher concentrations in vitro, cofilin stabilizes a more flexible, hyper-twisted state of actin known as ""cofilactin"". While this filament state is well studied, a structural role for cofilactin in dynamic cellular processes has not been observed. With a combination of cryo-electron tomography and fluorescence imaging in neuronal growth cones, we observe that filopodial actin filaments switch between a fascin-linked and a cofilin-decorated state, and that cofilactin is associated with a variety of dynamic events within filopodia. The switch to cofilactin filaments occurs in a graded fashion and correlates with a decline in fascin cross-linking within the filopodia, which is associated with curvature in the bundle. Our tomographic data reveal that the hyper-twisting of actin from cofilin binding leads to a rearrangement of filament packing, which largely excludes fascin from the base of filopodia. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the fundamentals of cytoskeletal remodeling inside of confined cellular spaces, and how the interplay between fascin and cofilin regulates the dynamics of searching filopodia."
101,science,Well-defined nanostructuring with designable anodic aluminum oxide template,"Well-defined nanostructuring over size, shape, spatial configuration, and multi-combination is a feasible concept to reach unique properties of nanostructure arrays, while satisfying such broad and stringent requirements with conventional techniques is challenging. Here, we report designable anodic aluminium oxide templates to address this challenge by achieving well-defined pore features within templates in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane shape, size, spatial configuration, and pore combination. The structural designability of template pores arises from designing of unequal aluminium anodization rates at different anodization voltages, and further relies on a systematic blueprint guiding pore diversification. Starting from the designable templates, we realize a series of nanostructures that inherit equal structural controllability relative to their template counterparts. Proof-of-concept applications based on such nanostructures demonstrate boosted performance. In light of the broad selectivity and high controllability, designable templates will provide a useful platform for well-defined nanostructuring."
102,science,Genome and transcriptome mechanisms driving cephalopod evolution,"Cephalopods are known for their large nervous systems, complex behaviors and morphological innovations. To investigate the genomic underpinnings of these features, we assembled the chromosomes of the Boston market squid, Doryteuthis (Loligo) pealeii, and the California two-spot octopus, Octopus bimaculoides, and compared them with those of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. The genomes of the soft-bodied (coleoid) cephalopods are highly rearranged relative to other extant molluscs, indicating an intense, early burst of genome restructuring. The coleoid genomes feature multi-megabase, tandem arrays of genes associated with brain development and cephalopod-specific innovations. We find that a known coleoid hallmark, extensive A-to-I mRNA editing, displays two fundamentally distinct patterns: one exclusive to the nervous system and concentrated in genic sequences, the other widespread and directed toward repetitive elements. We conclude that coleoid novelty is mediated in part by substantial genome reorganization, gene family expansion, and tissue-dependent mRNA editing."
103,science,Origin of high thermal conductivity in disentangled ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene films: ballistic phonons within enlarged crystals,"The thermal transport properties of oriented polymers are of fundamental and practical interest. High thermal conductivities (""‰â‰³""‰50 Wmâˆ’1Kâˆ’1) have recently been reported in disentangled ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) films, considerably exceeding prior reported values for oriented films. However, conflicting explanations have been proposed for the microscopic origin of the high thermal conductivity. Here, we report a characterization of the thermal conductivity and mean free path accumulation function of disentangled UHMWPE films (draw ratio""‰~200) using cryogenic steady-state thermal conductivity measurements and transient grating spectroscopy. We observe a marked dependence of the thermal conductivity on grating period over temperatures from 30""“300 K. Considering this observation, cryogenic bulk thermal conductivity measurements, and analysis using an anisotropic Debye model, we conclude that longitudinal atomic vibrations with mean free paths around 400 nanometers are the primary heat carriers, and that the high thermal conductivity for draw ratio""‰â‰³""‰150 arises from the enlargement of extended crystals with drawing. The mean free paths appear to remain limited by the extended crystal dimensions, suggesting that the upper limit of thermal conductivity of disentangled UHMWPE films has not yet been realized."
104,science,The dopamine transporter antiports potassium to increase the uptake of dopamine,"The dopamine transporter facilitates dopamine reuptake from the extracellular space to terminate neurotransmission. The transporter belongs to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family, which includes transporters for serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA that utilize the Na+ gradient to drive the uptake of substrate. Decades ago, it was shown that the serotonin transporter also antiports K+, but investigations of K+-coupled transport in other neurotransmitter:sodium symporters have been inconclusive. Here, we show that ligand binding to the Drosophila- and human dopamine transporters are inhibited by K+, and the conformational dynamics of the Drosophila dopamine transporter in K+ are divergent from the apo- and Na+-states. Furthermore, we find that K+ increases dopamine uptake by the Drosophila dopamine transporter in liposomes, and visualize Na+ and K+ fluxes in single proteoliposomes using fluorescent ion indicators. Our results expand on the fundamentals of dopamine transport and prompt a reevaluation of the impact of K+ on other transporters in this pharmacologically important family."

109,science,Scientists map living corals for the first time before and after marine heat wave: Winners and losers discovered,"As the world sees rising ocean temperatures, it will also see more cases of coral bleaching. When corals bleach, they become more vulnerable to other stressors such as water pollution. However, many reefs harbor corals that persist despite warming oceans. Unraveling the complex issue of coral bleaching and its impact on their survival or death may be key to conserving coral reefs— ecosystems that more than half a billion people around the world rely on for food, jobs, recreation and coastline protection."
110,science,A new model predicts forest tree growth in new environments,"Trees are an essential cornerstone in the functioning and survival of forest ecosystems. But as global change accelerates, certain tree populations, too slow to adapt, may experience population decline or even extinction. Conservation and forest management strategies can be implemented to avoid such scenarios, such as moving trees to more compatible climates, known as assisted gene flow, or to threatened populations that lack genetic diversity, known as evolutionary rescue. Because such strategies commit forest management authorities for several years, it is important to anticipate how transplanted trees will respond to their new environment."

Or maybe you live in a rural area and these views are an everyday part of your life. It's certainly quintessential Americana."
112,science,Sweet spots in the sea: Mountains of sugar under seagrass meadows,"Seagrasses play an important role in the climate. They are one of the most efficient sinks of carbon dioxide on Earth. A team of scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology now reports that seagrasses release large amounts of sugar, largely in the form of sucrose, into their soils—worldwide more than 1 million tons of sucrose, enough for 32 billion cans of coke. Such high concentrations of sugar are surprising. Normally, microorganisms quickly consume any free sugars in their environment. The scientists found that seagrasses excrete phenolic compounds, and these deter most microorganisms from degrading the sucrose. This ensures that the sucrose remains buried underneath the meadows and cannot be converted into CO2 and returned to the ocean and atmosphere. They now describe their discovery in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution."

122,science,STUDY: Wolves shown to reduce deer-versus-vehicle collisions,"Scientists found that an unconventional way of reducing the frequency of deer-auto collisions could be allowing wolves to roam a landscape. Because wolves prey on deer and also shift deer behavior, they make crashes about 24 percent less common. The researchers looked at data from Wisconsin and said that wolves reduce deer populations and also scare deer away from linear landscape features, including roads, that wolves often prowl."
123,science,"China is building an asteroid deflection mission of its own, due for launch in 2025","There's an old joke that the dinosaurs are only extinct because they didn't develop a space agency. The implication, of course, is that unlike our reptilian ancestors, we humans might be able to save ourselves from an impending asteroid strike on Earth, given our six-and-a-half decades of spaceflight experience. But the fact is that while we have achieved amazing things since Sputnik kicked off the space age in 1957, very little effort thus far has gone into developing asteroid deflection technologies. We are woefully inexperienced in this arena, and aside from our Hollywood dramatizations of it, we've never yet put our capabilities to the test. But that's about to change."
