But the bad news for anyone envisioning a lushly verdant lunar astronaut salad bar is that plants grown in lunar regolith don’t grow very well and are generally stressed out by the experience.In a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Biology, researchers at the University of Florida grew plants in lunar regolith from Nasa’s Apollo missions for the first time, comparing their growth to that of plants seeded in terrestrial volcanic ash.The lackluster performance of the plants..."
1,science,Haunting audio from a black hole allows humans to hear the sounds of space 240 million light-years away,"Is there sound in space? New audio released from NASA provides some insight – and the answer is haunting. The audio, released on May 4, is that of a black hole from the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster, a massive space structure that's 11 million light-years across and located about 240 million light-years away from Earth. Astronomers created the audible sound by recording the pressure waves that the black hole sent through the cluster's hot gas. In their original form, those waves cannot be heard by the human ear, so scientists extracted the sound waves and scaled them up by 57 and 58 octaves."

Brain death is when someone is no longer able to survive without life support, unable to breathe on their own.

It is considered irreversible and therefore a person is declared as dead.

159,science,Study sheds light on what influences water supplied by snowmelt,"Water often falls from the sky and is stored in mountains across the U.S. as snow before it melts and flows down to urban and rural communities. Knowing what factors influence when and how much of that snowmelt ultimately makes it to streams, rivers and reservoirs is crucial for water managers trying to make the most of limited water resources. A new study led by researchers at University of Nevada, Reno and the Desert Research Institute (DRI) published in Environmental Research Letters identifies three major factors that influence snowmelt-driven water supplies and identifies regions where mountain water supplies respond differently to climate change. The study used data from 537 watersheds across the U.S."

167,science,Feast your eyes on the first image of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way,"At the heart of our Milky Way galaxy lurks a supermassive black hole more than four million times the mass of our Sun. Scientists with the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration have now produced the first image of that black hole, showing that it has a ring structure. The collaboration made the announcement during a livestreamed press conference this morning from the European Southern Observatory's headquarters in Munich, Germany, as well as numerous other simultaneous press conferences around the world. Six papers about the research have been published in a special issue of The Astronomical Journal Letters."

172,science,Creating a biomimetic algorithm to find epileptogenic areas of the brain,"Researchers from the HSE University Centre for Bioelectric Interfaces have designed a new method for detecting diagnostic markers of epilepsy, called interictal spikes, using EEG and MEG. Capable of accounting for various errors and artifacts, this method constitutes a valuable addition to the arsenal of means for automatic analysis of electrophysiological recordings in epilepsy patients, especially when the data are noisy. Precise localization of epileptogenic cortical structures can enhance the effectiveness of neurosurgical interventions. The study is published in the Journal of Neural Engineering."

177,science,Copper Eliminates the COVID-19 Virus on Surfaces – Silver Does Not,"Copper and silver are known for their antibacterial properties. Researchers from Bochum have explored their effectiveness against viruses. Many pathogens are destroyed by silver and copper ions. As a result, these metals are often used to coat implants and medical instruments. Researchers from Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUBMolecular )’s and Medical Virology and Materials Research departments, in collaboration with Surgical Research at the Bergmannsheil University Hospital in Bochum, investigated whether these metals could also help contain the Covid-19 pandemic by rendering the Sars-Cov-2 virus harmless. They demonstrated that a copper coating eliminates the virus. The same cannot be said for silver. On May 3, 2022, the team published their findings in the journal Scientific Reports."
