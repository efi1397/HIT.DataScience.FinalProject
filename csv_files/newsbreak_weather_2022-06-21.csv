110,weather,Dynamics and characteristics of dry and moist heatwaves over East Asia,"Npj Climate and Atmospheric Science volumeÂ 5, ArticleÂ number:Â 49 (2022) Cite this article. The increasing frequency of heatwaves over East Asia (EA) is impacting agriculture, water management, and people's livelihood. However, the effect of humidity on high-temperature events has not yet been fully explored. Using observations and future climate change projections conducted with the latest generation of Earth System models, we examine the mechanisms of dry and moist heatwaves over EA. In the dry heatwave region, anticyclonic circulation has been amplified after the onset of heatwaves under the influence of the convergence of anomalous wave activity flux over northern EA, resulting in surface warming via adiabatic processes. In contrast, the moist heatwaves are triggered by the locally generated anticyclonic anomalies, with the surface warming amplified by cloud and water vapor feedback. Model simulations from phase six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project projected display intensification of dry heatwaves and increased moist heatwave days in response to projected increases in greenhouse gas concentrations."

Less rain in these areas is an expected consequence of global warming. In both the northern and southern hemispheres, the paths of the weather systems that bring rain in the middle latitudes have been moving away from the equator and towards the poles.

Today is the last full day of the spring season, and it's going to feel very spring-like, with dry weather and warm temperatures. The area of low pressure that brought our active weather and cooler temperatures over the weekend is now off to our northeast, but will continue to leave us with some clouds overhead and breezy north winds Monday. High pressure off the coast in the Pacific will track closer to the coast today, and will drive a substantial warming trend ahead in our forecast this week. Temperatures are mild with mostly clear to partly cloudy skies over northern California to start your Monday. We'll continue to have partly cloudy skies early to mid day, but we'll end up mostly sunny across the majority of our region Monday afternoon. Temperatures are starting out in the 60's in the valley, 50's to 60's in the foothills, and 30's to 40's in our mountain areas Monday morning. Winds will be out of the north to 15mph, and gusts up to around 25mph look likely through the day. Humidity will dip to below 15 percent, and those dry conditions paired with the gusty north winds and warming temperatures will drive moderate to high fire danger in your Monday forecast. High temperatures are on rise today, and will top out in the low to mid 90's in the valley. Foothill areas will range from the mid 70's to mid 80's this afternoon, while mountain areas climb into the low 70's to mid 80's Monday."
