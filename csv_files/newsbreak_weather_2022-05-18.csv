129,weather,Amplifying subtropical hydrological transition over China in early summer tied to weakened mid-latitude synoptic disturbances,"Npj Climate and Atmospheric Science volumeÂ 5, ArticleÂ number:Â 40 (2022) Cite this article. The rainy season over southern China (SC) begins with the onset of the South China Sea monsoon around mid-May. We demonstrate here that the SC precipitation exhibits a notable drying (wetting) trend prior to (after) the monsoon onset, leading to a more abrupt thus amplified hydrological transition over SC in early summer. The contrasting precipitation trends are largely driven by the recent decline in mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity. Weakened mid-latitude synoptic disturbances suppress SC frontal activities before the monsoon onset, facilitating the drying trend, and enhance the spatial stationarity of the SC monsoonal front after the monsoon onset, leading to the wetting trend. CMIP6 models in general fail to capture the contrasting trends between the two periods. In models where both the trends in precipitation and mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity are well captured, the amplification of the hydrological transition over SC is projected to continue well into the late 21st century. Our results highlight the footprints of hemispheric-scale climate change in regional hydroclimate and the obvious challenges faced by climate models in capturing such footprints."

135,weather,Shift of the storm surge season in Europe due to climate variability,"Along the European coasts, changes in the timing of the storm surge season are analyzed. Using 10 long-term tide gauges located in western Europe, a consistent spatio-temporal shift emerged in the storm surge season between 1950 and 2000. Temporal shifts are positive (later events) in the North, negative (earlier events) in the South. Extreme surge events occurred about 4 days/decade later in northern Europe, and 5 days/decade earlier in southern Europe. Such a tendency is similar to the one already reported for European river floods between 1960 and 2010. In northern Europe, extreme surges are known to occur during the positive North Atlantic Oscillation phase (NAO+). Identified spatio-temporal shifts likely trace that NAO+ storms tend to occur later between 1950 and 2000. A new index measuring the timing of the NAO+ and NAOâˆ’ persistent situations is shown to help capture this spatial distribution in the timing of the storm surge seasons."
