166,science,Worried about coming off as fake? Relax: New study says humans are terrible at gauging authenticity,"If there is one human trait that is universally prized, it is authenticity. Our literary heroes attest to this: protagonist Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" famously denounced the bulk of humanity as ""phonies"" — epitomizing the human tendency to valued those who remain genuine and deride fakers. Accordingly, most of us, Holden included, like to believe that we are skilled at differentiating between individuals who are authentic and those who are phony."
167,science,The hydroxylation of ASPP2 and other ankyrin repeat domain proteins,"Factor Inhibiting Hypoxia Inducible Factor (FIH) has an important role in the response to low oxygen (hypoxia) in animals. FIH adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group onto the master regulator Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), influencing its ability to activate hundreds of genes that mediate the body's response to hypoxia. It also hydroxylates members of the ankyrin repeat domain protein family, including adding a single hydroxyl group to ASPP2 on asparagine 986."
168,science,Shattered comet set to ‘spawn’ new meteor shower in the next week,"A new meteor shower could materialize from a crumbling comet and here’s how to watch it.

On the evening of Monday, May 30, astronomy lovers may get to see a brand new meteor shower light up the night sky.

Dubbed the ‘tau Herculids’, this meteor display might be one of the most dramatic observed in over two decades, according to Space.com.

What are meteor showers?

Meteor showers occur when dust or particles from asteroids or comets enter Earth’s atmosphere at a very high speed.

This particular display of ‘shooting stars’ is expected to be the product of a comet named 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, also known as SW3.

SW3 was first..."
