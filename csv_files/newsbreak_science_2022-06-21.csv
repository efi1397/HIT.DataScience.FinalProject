5,science,A major geomagnetic storm? An 'enormous' sunspot is set to burst,"Space weather experts are keeping a keen eye on the solar spot directly facing the Earth, which has doubled in size in the past 24 hours, Spaceweather.com reported. Solar spots, commonly called sun spots, are temporary spots that appear darker than the solar surface. A sunspot can be as small as 10 miles (16 km) but can also grow to hundreds of thousands of miles in diameter, making them visible from Earth, even without a telescope. Sunspots can last from a few days to a few months and even move across the solar surface as they expand and contract in size."

Now, a new experiment conducted deep underground, more than two kilometers below Russia’s Caucasus Mountains, has confirmed the anomaly seen previously, pointing towards an as-of-yet-unconfirmed new elementary particle called the ‘sterile neutrino’.

33,science,Recent marine heatwaves in the North Pacific warming pool can be attributed to rising atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases,"Communications Earth & Environment volumeÂ 3, ArticleÂ number:Â 131 (2022) Cite this article. Over the last decade, the northeast Pacific experienced marine heatwaves that caused devastating marine ecological impacts with socioeconomic implications. Here we use two different attribution methods and show that forcing by elevated greenhouse gases levels has virtually certainly caused the multi-year persistent 2019""“2021 marine heatwave. There is less than 1% chance that the 2019""“2021 event with""‰~3 years duration and 1.6""‰âˆ˜C intensity could have happened in the absence of greenhouse gases forcing. We further discover that the recent marine heatwaves are co-located with a systematically-forced outstanding warming pool, which we attribute to forcing by elevated greenhouse gases levels and the recent industrial aerosol-load decrease. The here-detected Pacific long-term warming pool is associated with a strengthening ridge of high-pressure system, which has recently emerged from the natural variability of climate system, indicating that they will provide favorable conditions over the northeast Pacific for even more severe marine heatwave events in the future."

87,science,Quantum causal unravelling,"Complex processes often arise from sequences of simpler interactions involving a few particles at a time. These interactions, however, may not be directly accessible to experiments. Here we develop the first efficient method for unravelling the causal structure of the interactions in a multipartite quantum process, under the assumption that the process has bounded information loss and induces causal dependencies whose strength is above a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) threshold. Our method is based on a quantum algorithm whose complexity scales polynomially in the total number of input/output systems, in the dimension of the systems involved in each interaction, and in the inverse of the chosen threshold for the strength of the causal dependencies. Under additional assumptions, we also provide a second algorithm that has lower complexity and requires only local state preparation and local measurements. Our algorithms can be used to identify processes that can be characterized efficiently with the technique of quantum process tomography. Similarly, they can be used to identify useful communication channels in quantum networks, and to test the internal structure of uncharacterized quantum circuits."

163,science,Our Cancer Floriscope: An All-White Arrangement Brings Beauty and Peace to This Water Sign's Home,"Calling all crabs! As the sun enters the fourth sign of the zodiac from June 21 through July 22, we are celebrating Cancers, the sentimental water sign with an innate desire to nurture. “The domestic crab likes to turn their personal space into their sanctuary. Cultivating a sense of comfort at home helps them unwind and relax,” says Sanctuary astrologer Lauren Ash. “Cancers love having fresh flowers in their home. They want to treat their dwelling right,” adds astrologer Lisa Stardust. To help crabs incorporate natural beauty into their habitats, VERANDA editors called on Birmingham florist Mark Thompson to design an arrangement that brings Cancers’ characteristics to life."
164,science,Black death: How we solved the centuries-old mystery of its origins,"It is not an exaggeration to say that the question of where and when the Black Death, the deadliest pandemic ever, originated is one of the biggest mysteries in human history. After all, the Black Death was the first wave of the second plague pandemic of the 14th to early 19th centuries. It killed some 50–60% of the population in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and an unaccountable number of people in Central Asia."

174,science,Peer review: Can this critical step in the publication of science research be kinder?,"Democracy has been called the least worst system of government. Peer review is the least worst system for assessing the merit of scientific work. Peer review is the written evaluation of a paper by other experts in the field. Though this sounds like assessment by equals, the power imbalance created by the roles of reviewer and reviewed distorts the relationship and affects the tone of the review. Reviews can be patronizing, demanding and unkind."

182,science,hnRNPC induces isoform shifts in miR-21-5p leading to cancer development,"Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022)Cite this article. MicroRNA (miRNA) processing is a critical step in mature miRNA production. Its dysregulation leads to an increase in miRNA isoforms with heterogenous 5""²-ends (isomiRs), which can recognize distinct target sites because of their shifted seed sequence. Although some miRNA genes display productive expression of their 5""²-isomiRs in cancers, how their production is controlled and how 5""²-isomiRs affect tumor progression have yet to be explored. In this study, based on integrative analyses of high-throughput sequencing data produced by our group and publicly available data, we demonstrate that primary miR-21 (pri-miR-21) is processed into the cancer-specific isomiR isomiR-21-5p""‰|""‰Â±1, which suppresses growth hormone receptor (GHR) in liver cancer. Treatment with antagomirs against isomiR-21-5p""‰|""‰Â±1 inhibited the in vitro tumorigenesis of liver cancer cells and allowed the recovery of GHR, whereas the introduction of isomiR-21-5p""‰|""‰Â±1 mimics attenuated these effects. These effects were validated in a mouse model of spontaneous liver cancer. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C and U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 were predicted to bind upstream of pre-miR-21 via a poly-(U) motif and influence Drosha processing to induce the production of isomiR-21-5p""‰|""‰Â±1. Our findings suggest an oncogenic function for the non-canonical isomiR-21-5p""‰|""‰Â±1 in liver cancer, and its production was shown to be regulated by hnRNPC."

184,science,Spatial distribution and ecological risk assessment of potentially toxic metals in the Sundarbans mangrove soils of Bangladesh,"At present, there are growing concerns over the increasing release of trace metals in the Sundarbans mangrove areas in Bangladesh due to nearby shipbreaking and metallurgical industries, untreated waste discharge, navigation activities, and other natural processes that deposit trace metals into soils. The current study investigated the spatial distribution, contamination level, and ecotoxicity of eight trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni) in Sundarbans soils. Results revealed that all the trace metals except Cr were present in higher concentrations compared to Earth's shale and/or upper continental crust. Principal component analysis and Pearson correlation showed strong positive correlations (p""‰<""‰0.05) between Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn; Ni with Mn and Cr. There were significant associations (p""‰<""‰0.05) of % clay and total organic carbon (TOC) with Pb-Ni-Cr and negative correlations of pH with all the trace metals. The hierarchical cluster analysis grouped Pb, Ni, and Cd into one distinct cluster, suggesting they are derived from the same sources, possibly from anthropogenic activities. Geo accumulation index (I-geo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), and spatial distribution showed moderately polluted soils with Ni, Pb, and Cd (EF""‰=""‰3""“7.4, CF""‰=""‰1""“2.8, I-geo""‰=""‰0""“0.9) and low pollution by Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn (EF""‰<""‰3, CF""‰<""‰1, I-geo""‰<""‰0). The ecological risk index (RI) revealed that S-4 (RI""‰=""‰114.02) and S-5 (RI""‰=""‰100.04) belonged to moderate risk, and other areas posed a low risk (RI""‰<""‰95). The individual contribution of Cd (25.9""“73.7%), Pb (9.2""“29.1%), and Ni (9.6""“26.4%) to RI emphasized these metals were the foremost concern in the Sundarbans mangroves due to their long persistence time and high toxicity, even if they were present in low concentrations."
