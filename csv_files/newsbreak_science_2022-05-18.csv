2,science,Zinc is a metal essential to life – scientists have discovered a protein that helps keep cells alive when zinc levels are low,"All living things, including people, need zinc in their diets. Getting too little of this essential metal can impair growth and cause immune dysfunction, neurological disorders and cancer. Unfortunately, over 17% of the world’s population is at risk for zinc deficiency. The World Health Organization considers this kind of micronutrient-related malnutrition a leading contributor to disease and death.

After you eat a meal, zinc is taken up by the cells of your body. Inside each cell, zinc binds to proteins to support their structure and function. Researchers estimate that up to 10% of all proteins need zinc to properly function. In..."

It speaks metaphorically about our place in the cosmos, but it turns out to be a very literal truth. Our bodies contain the stuff of stars and galaxies, and that makes us children of the cosmos. To be more precise, we are carbon-based life forms. All life on Earth is based on the element carbon-12. It turns out this stuff is a critical gateway to life. So, how did the universe come up with enough of it to make you and me and all the life on our planet? Astrophysicists and nuclear physicists think they have an answer by using a supercomputer simulation of what happens to create carbon. As it turns out, it’s not very easy."

However, little knowledge exists on the identity of the parasite species or their effects on the cephalopod community. With the help of ROV-collected specimens and in situ footage from the past 27Â years, we report on their identity, prevalence and potential infection strategy. Gill parasites were genetically and morphologically identified from collected specimens of Chiroteuthis calyx, Vampyroteuthis infernalis and Gonatus spp. In situ prevalence was estimated from video footage for C. calyx, Galiteuthis spp., Taonius spp. and Japetella diaphana, enabled by their transparent mantle tissue. The most common parasite was identified as Hochbergia cf. moroteuthensis, a protist of unresolved taxonomic ranking. We provide the first molecular data for this parasite and show a sister group relationship to the dinoflagellate genus Oodinium. Hochbergia cf. moroteuthensis was most commonly observed in adult individuals of all species and was sighted year round over the analyzed time period. In situ prevalence was highest in C. calyx (75%), followed by Galiteuthis spp. (29%), Taonius spp. (27%) and J. diaphana (7%). A second parasite, not seen on the in situ footage, but occurring within the gills of Gonatus berryi and Vampyroteuthis infernalis, could not be found in the literature or be identified through DNA barcoding. The need for further investigation is highlighted, making this study a starting point for unravelling ecological implications of the cephalopod-gill-parasite system in deep pelagic waters."

84,science,Towards a microwave single-photon counter for searching axions,"The major task of detecting axions or axion-like particles has two challenges. On the one hand, the ultimate sensitivity is required, down to the energy of a single microwave photon of the yoctojoule range. On the other hand, since the detected events are supposed to be rare, the dark count rate of the detector must be extremely low. We show that this trade-off can be approached due to the peculiar switching dynamics of an underdamped Josephson junction in the phase diffusion regime. The detection of a few photons' energy at 10""‰GHz with dark count time above 10""‰s and the efficiency close to unity was demonstrated. Further enhancements require a detailed investigation of the junction switching dynamics."

88,science,"Discovery of Late Triassic bivalves from Jurassic deep-water deposits in Riganpeicuo area, Tibet and their geological significance","The Jurassic sequences in the South Qiangtang Basin of Tibet are essential for understanding the paleogeography and tectonic evolution of this basin and the Bangong-Nujiang Meso-Tethys Ocean (BNMO). However, the partial absence of fossils hinders the study of the stratigraphic distribution and tectonic paleogeography of the basin. Late Triassic bivalves, including nine species in nine genera, were identified for the first time in olistostromes from the SÃªwa Formation in the Riganpeicuo area. Based on detailed geological field surveys and sedimentary facies analysis, the lower-middle part of the Rigenco section is a deep-water turbidite fan deposit and the upper part is a shallow sea mixed shelf deposit, which differs distinctively from the carbonate platform facies of the Jiebuqu Formation. Therefore, the strata formerly assigned to the Jiebuqu Formation (Rigenco section) is formally reassigned to the Lower-Middle Jurassic SÃªwa Formation and Middle Jurassic Shaqiaomu Formation. These results not only provide further understanding of the sedimentary infill history of the South Qiangtang Basin, but also further support that the BNMO was already open in the Late Triassic and formed a mature ocean in the Early-Middle Jurassic, with subsequent rapid subduction. Both the opening and subduction processes were completed in a relatively short time interval with a large number of attendant olistostromes."

97,science,Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants revealed by genomic surveillance,"Co-infections with different variants of SARS-CoV-2 are a key precursor to recombination events that are likely to drive SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Rapid identification of such co-infections is required to determine their frequency in the community, particularly in populations at-risk of severe COVID-19, which have already been identified as incubators for punctuated evolutionary events. However, limited data and tools are currently available to detect and characterise the SARS-CoV-2 co-infections associated with recognised variants of concern. Here we describe co-infectionÂ with the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Omicron and Delta in two epidemiologically unrelated adult patients with chronic kidney disease requiring maintenance haemodialysis. Both variants were co-circulating in the community at the time of detection. Genomic surveillance based on amplicon- and probe-based sequencing using short- and long-read technologies identified and quantified subpopulations of Delta and Omicron viruses in respiratory samples. These findings highlight the importance of integrated genomic surveillance in vulnerable populations and provide diagnostic pathways to recognise SARS-CoV-2 co-infection using genomic data."

108,science,A compilation of fecal microbiome shotgun metagenomics from hematopoietic cell transplantation patients,"Hospitalized patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplants provide a unique opportunity to study the human gut microbiome. We previously compiled a large-scale longitudinal dataset of fecal microbiota and associated metadata, but we had limited that analysis to taxonomic composition of bacteria from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here we augment those data with shotgun metagenomics. The compilation amounts to a nested subset of 395 samples compiled from different studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Shotgun metagenomics describes the microbiome at the functional level, particularly in antimicrobial resistances and virulence factors. We provide accession numbers that link each sample to the paired-end sequencing files deposited in a public repository, which can be directly accessed by the online services of PATRIC to be analyzed without the users having to download or transfer the files. Then, we show how shotgun sequencing enables the assembly of genomes from metagenomic data. The new data, combined with the metadata published previously, enables new functional studies of the microbiomes of patients with cancer receiving bone marrow transplantation."

116,science,Simultaneous determination of gross alpha/beta activities in water by liquid scintillation counting and its applications in the environmental monitoring,"Based on the standards of ISO11704-2018 and ASTM D7283-17, a method for simultaneous determination of gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations in water by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) was established, which can be applied to various types of water samples in routine monitoring, such as drinking water, groundwater, geothermal water, seawater, and radioactive wastewater. The sample's pH value and concentrated volume must be controlled to avoid quenching as much as possible. The validation tests show that the deviations of gross alpha and gross beta activities can satisfy quality control requirements in a wide range of activity ratios from 1:102 to 67:1. For the actual samples, the measurement results of the LSC method are in good agreement with those of the thick source method, in which the relative deviations of gross alpha and gross beta are both less than 15% for these two methods. Moreover, the LSC method performs better in detection limit and has a simpler pretreatment process than the thick source method."

174,science,Modeling of wave run-up by applying integrated models of group method of data handling,"Wave-induced inundation in coastal zones is a serious problem for residents. Accurate prediction of wave run-up height is a complex phenomenon in coastal engineering. In this study, several machine learning (ML) models are developed to simulate wave run-up height. The developed methods are based on optimization techniques employing the group method of data handling (GMDH). The invasive weed optimization (IWO), firefly algorithm (FA), teaching""“learning-based optimization (TLBO), harmony search (HS), and differential evolution (DE) meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are embedded with the GMDH to yield better feasible optimization. Preliminary results indicate that the developed ML models are robust tools for modeling the wave run-up height. All ML models' accuracies are higher than empirical relations. The obtained results show that employing heuristic methods enhances the accuracy of the standard GMDH model. As such, the FA, IWO, DE, TLBO, and HS improve the RMSE criterion of the standard GMDH by the rate of 47.5%, 44.7%, 24.1%, 41.1%, and 34.3%, respectively. The GMDH-FA and GMDH-IWO are recommended for applications in coastal engineering."

177,science,Change of temperature causes whole body reprogramming,"Human beings, like most organisms, are constantly exposed to alternating colder or warmer temperatures. These environmental variations cause striking metabolic effects and require constant adaptations. While some of these adaptations confer certain beneficial effects on health, the impact of cold and warmth on the various organs in a whole-body context was not known. To understand the overall biological mechanism at stake, a team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) analyzed changes in gene expression simultaneously in various organs in mice. They discovered that all organs strongly react to temperature changes, each showing its own specific modulation. To stimulate research and potential therapeutic applications, the scientists created a web-based application where thousands of gene expression profiles are freely accessible. These results can be read in the journal eLife."
178,science,Singlet and triplet to doublet energy transfer: improving organic light-emitting diodes with radicals,"Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) must be engineered to circumvent the efficiency limit imposed by the 3:1 ratio of triplet to singlet exciton formation following electron-hole capture. Here we show the spin nature of luminescent radicals such as TTM-3PCz allows direct energy harvesting from both singlet and triplet excitons through energy transfer, with subsequent rapid and efficient light emission from the doublet excitons. This is demonstrated with a model Thermally-Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) organic semiconductor, 4CzIPN, where reverse intersystem crossing from triplets is characteristically slow (50% emission by 1 Âµs). The radical:TADF combination shows much faster emission via the doublet channel (80% emission by 100""‰ns) than the comparable TADF-only system, and sustains higher electroluminescent efficiency with increasing current density than a radical-only device. By unlocking energy transfer channels between singlet, triplet and doublet excitons, further technology opportunities are enabled for optoelectronics using organic radicals."
