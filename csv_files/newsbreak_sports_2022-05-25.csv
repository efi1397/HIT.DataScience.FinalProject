Coming into the 2022 season, Isiah Kiner-Falefa (IKF) was a career 80 OPS+ / 81 wRC+ hitter. On the defensive side, he was mainly a third baseman and sometimes second baseman (and rarely a shortstop) for the Rangers until 2021. Last year, he had his first season as the full-time shortstop."

A lot could change for the Jazz. I’m still of the opinion that they will not move Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert this offseason, opting instead to give them one more year to see if they can make this duo work, but with big changes to the supporting cast. The Jazz haven’t been to the Western Conference Finals since 2007. If you have two perennial All-Stars on your team, you can’t let that happen."

Very few folks thought they’d land a player anywhere near James Harden’s caliber. It took more than a little madness and devotion in order to wind up with this deal of all deals. But lately, many of those same folks are now second guessing the move in part because of Harden’s shaky playoff showing and pending (possibly record breaking) contract situation."

191,sports,Anthony Rizzo’s predictability is showing itself,"Anthony Rizzo has undoubtedly been a important part of this Yankees lineup, but there has been a lot of contrast in his production over the course of the first two months of 2022. In April, the Yankees’ first baseman was one of the most productive players in baseball, putting up a 206 wRC+ and hitting nine home runs, the most in the sport, in just under 100 plate appearances. Now, in the first few weeks of May, Rizzo’s wRC+ sits at 77. His season total still sits at 146, an excellent mark, but that contrast is worth looking at. The odd thing is that not a lot has changed about the way or the quality with which Rizzo is hitting the ball. Instead, this month Rizzo seems to be playing into his tendencies more than ever, and opposing defenses are taking advantage."
