64,food,Alternative Health Education GM FOOD,"Health There Are Serious Issues And Consequences With A Genetically Modified Food Supply There are many serious issues that plague Genetically Modified (GM or GMO) foods. The world‚Äôs top scientists have risked their livelihood to come out and warn us about the dangers of GM foods and how bad they are for our health as well as the environment. Unfortunately, big agriculture companies in alignment with governments are doing whatever they can to hide and ignore the dangers so that they can line their pockets with huge profits. Of course, they would rather have you believe that they are doing their part to save the world from starvation. But little do they know that they are leading the world‚Äôs food supply into a very dark and dangerous place. And when it gets to that point, when they realize what they did was wrong, it will be too late for anyone to do anything about it. It will be irreversible! Covering Up the Dangers In 1998, Dr. Arpad Pusztai, Ph.D., was commissioned to do a study on potatoes that were genetically modified with a lectin gene from a European plant named Galanthus Nivalis. He placed the gene into the potatoes and fed those genetically engineered potatoes to lab rats. The results were of concern. What was noticed was that the organs of the rats had become critically damaged. In addition, their immune systems were severely weakened. Dr. Pusztai issued a warning to the British public by revealing his startling test results and the need for further testing in order to confirm the dangers. Needless to say, a scandal broke out to discredit Dr. Pusztai and he was immediately forced to keep quiet and retire. Further Research Confirms the Dangers In 2005, doctor of Biology Irina Ermakova released the results of a research study she led at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This study showed the results of what happened to rats born to mothers that consumed genetically modified soy. And seeing that the biochemical structures of rats are similar to that of humans, makes the results ever more disturbing. Basically, 56% of the rats born to those mothers who ate GM Soy died within three weeks. This is very disturbing because the death rate amongst rats born to mothers that ate regular soy was only 9%. Here is another example of the dangers of GM food. In 1997, a farmer found evidence that feeding genetically modified corn to his cattle was responsible for systematically killing his cattle, the destruction of the production of his milk, and the toxic poisoning of his farmland. This particular strain of corn was engineered to create its own toxin that would make the corn resistant to a damaging and deadly insect. These are just two examples of the many dangerous results GM foods are having on our health and food supply. With allergies and disease reaching levels never before seen, and the ages of people affected becoming younger and younger; should there be any doubt that GM foods are playing a role in the destruction of our DNA? If you would like to learn more about the cover-ups and dangers of GM foods, read a copy of ‚ÄúSeeds of Deception‚Äù by Jeffrey M. Smith. It documents the health dangers of GM foods and the political and industrial influence that allow these foods into our supermarkets. The Worlds Food Supply Is In Danger GM foods have the potential of irreversibly damaging our planet‚Äôs entire ecosystem and very little is being done by our government to stop this. There are serious consequences and repercussions that are yet to be realized. Gene contaminations can‚Äôt be simply cleaned up like chemical disasters. When these gene contaminants become a part of our environment, there is no way of removing them. They are irreversible. They become a part of the environment and ecosystem. Every living organism becomes exposed to these contaminants as well as their unknown side effects. Who knows how they genetically mutate from there. It‚Äôs beyond our control! Why is it beyond our control? Simply put, cross-pollination. Genetically engineered crop fields cross-pollinate with neighboring crops which can create new and possibly harmful species. Wind, birds, and insects carry seeds into fields nearby as well as afar. In the vast outdoors, cross-pollination cannot be controlled and genetically engineered crops are not immune to it. Not only this, organic fields are at risk of being contaminated. Pollen from GM crops can easily cross-pollinate with organic crops thus contaminating entire crops. In 1996, there were only 6,500 square miles of farmland in the world that was devoted to GM crops. In just 10 years, that figure has exponentially grown to 390,000 square miles. And that is not considering the natural effect of cross-pollination. Unbelievable! At that rate, our entire food supply will be in danger of being GM. Truly organic food will be a thing of the past. The Fight Against GM ‚Äî Choose Organic. It is not easy fighting a giant such as Monsanto, especially when they have the support of our government. It‚Äôs bad enough that our corn, potato, and soy supply has gotten to the point where they are 100% contaminated. Chances are very high that when you eat out, GM food will be included on your plate. How much further must this go before our entire food supply is overrun by GM foods? If we are to protect our food supply, we must fight. Organic farmers are doing their best to make a stand and hurt Monsanto where they feel it the most, their profit margins. When you choose organic, you place your vote and your money against GM foods. If it wasn‚Äôt for our organic farmers or the supermarkets dedicated to organic foods, the Monsantos of our universe would have us eating nothing else except for their dangerous GM foods. We have a right to know what we are eating. We also have a right to healthy and nutritious food. Tests that show the dangers of GM should be acted upon and not swept under the rug, strong-armed, or paid off with bribes. Biotech firms do their testing without third-party supervision and are not required to let the FDA know if they are aware of any problems. This must be stopped. The future of our food supply is at risk. There are organizations and campaigns that are doing what they can to fight against GM. If you want to take action and voice your opinion against Genetically Engineered Foods, visit: organicconsumers.org. And remember, choose organic whenever possible. Your body will thank you.
