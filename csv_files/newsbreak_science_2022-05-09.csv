55,science,How Mercury Retrograde Went Viral,"Contracts, text messages, ex messages, and shopping for electronic devices: Astrologers tell us to steer clear of such activities when Mercury appears to reverse course in the night sky, going from east to west in “retrograde” motion. (It isn’t actually moving backward; it’s an illusion created by the fact that Earth and Mercury go around the sun at different speeds.) The astrological theory maintains that during these phases, which occur three or four times a year and last roughly three weeks each, Mercury, which rules communications, undergoes a kind of symbolic reversal, throwing the domain of its influence into disarray. In an era when we’re reliant on the accurate transmission of meaning and data from one place to another, when everything we say or post or send is so open to misinterpretation and bad-faith reading—on social media, on group chats, on Slack—a whole discourse has sprung up around Mercury’s supposed effect on the tech that’s closest to our hearts."
